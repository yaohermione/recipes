my favourite food is steamed fish
1. wash the fish and put it in a bowl
2. rub a thin layer of salt on the fish surface
3. put several slices of ginger and garlic on or inside the fish
4. put the bowl in the spoiling water of a pot for around 10 minutes
5. scatter chopped scallion on the fish when finished steaming
6. boil a bit of oil in a pan and pour it on the fish.
7. enjoy it !
